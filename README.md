# File Encryption Tool - Operating Systems Project

A comprehensive file encryption and decryption tool built with Python, demonstrating core Operating Systems concepts including file system operations, security mechanisms, and user interfaces.

## Project Overview

This project implements a secure file encryption system that showcases:

- **File System Operations**: Reading, writing, and manipulating files
- **Security Mechanisms**: AES-256 encryption using Fernet
- **User Interfaces**: Both console-based and graphical interfaces
- **Memory Management**: Secure handling of encryption keys
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Features

### Key Management

- Generate cryptographically secure encryption keys
- Save and load key files
- Password-based key derivation
- Key validation and error handling

### File Encryption

- Encrypt any file type (text, images, videos, etc.)
- AES-256 encryption for maximum security
- Batch file processing capabilities
- Original file deletion option for security

### File Decryption

- Decrypt files with correct key
- Integrity verification
- Error handling for invalid keys or corrupted files
- Automatic file extension management

### User Interfaces

- **Console Interface**: Full-featured command-line interface
- **GUI Interface**: Modern graphical interface with tabs
- **File Manager**: Browse and manage encrypted files
- **Activity Logging**: Track all operations with timestamps
